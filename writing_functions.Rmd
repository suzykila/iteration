##writing my first function

as an example, here's a z-score computation.

```{r}
x_vec= rnorm(n=25, mean=10, sd=3.5)

(x_vec - mean(x_vec))/ sd(x_vec)
```

Now i'll write a function to do this.
```{r}
z_scores=function(x){
  
  if (!is.numeric(x)){
    stop("x needs to be numeric")
  }
  
  if (length(x)<5){
    stop("you need at least 5 numbers to compute z scores")
  }
  
  z= (x-mean(x))/sd(x)
  
  return(z)
}

z_scores(x=x_vec)
```

does this always work?
```{r, error=TRUE}
z_scores(x=3)
z_scores(x=c("My","name","is"))
```
